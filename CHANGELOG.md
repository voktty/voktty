# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.18] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Sounds in Settings → General: a short cue when a turn finishes, when a new inbox item lights the project-rail dot, or when an update is available. Switches click, and Copy on a finished turn plays a scan. Off mutes every cue.

### Fixed

- Skill tool rows only said `Skill`. They now show `Skill /name`, the same way reads show the file. In #32.
- Shell tool rows only showed the tool name (`bash` / `Bash`) for Claude, Pi, and some other providers, so you could not see or cancel the command that was about to run. The activity ticker now shows the command itself, matching Codex. In #32.
- The `@` mention picker in the composer only offered files, so you could not point the agent at a folder. Directories from the project tree are selectable now. In #34.
- Codex turns looked finished while the agent was still working: “Worked for” froze and the composer stop button went back to send, even though tools and text kept arriving. The turn now stays live until Codex actually completes it.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Second opinion: the scale icon next to Copy on a finished turn sends that work to another provider in a split pane. Hover a provider to pick its model. The reviewing session shows a compact card instead of the review prompt.

### Changed

- Provider CLIs stay warm for five minutes after a turn so follow-ups stay instant, then park. Title/commit one-shots no longer leave a second process running. The usage footer only polls Claude/Codex when a session in this window actually uses them.

### Fixed

- `npm run set-version` left `package-lock.json` behind, so the lockfile still called itself 0.1.0 sixteen releases on. The script now updates both of the version fields it carries, and the lockfile is back in sync.
- Closing a tab in Deck keeps the active tab in the current project when another tab from that project is open. In #22 by @kinsomicrote.
- Closing the last tab of a project in Deck no longer jumps to another project. Command+W stays where you are; Classic layout still flows across mixed-project tabs.
- Unused provider CLIs no longer start at launch. Catalog probes run only for harnesses in the restored workspace, or when you open that provider in the model picker. Pi/omp probes skip extensions so a leftover `pi` process cannot sit at ~1GB while you work in Codex or Claude. Diagnosed in #19.
- A Pi or omp turn that fails now reports why. Pi puts the failure on the assistant message (`stopReason: "error"`) instead of an error frame, so an expired provider token ended empty and looked like the agent ignoring you. In #23 by @emircan-sahin.
- The context meter stayed at zero for a Pi or omp turn. Usage lives on the assistant message (and the streaming partial), not the top of the frame. In #23 by @emircan-sahin.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Toggle zen mode with `⌘⌥Z` (`Ctrl+Alt+Z` on Windows and Linux).

### Changed

- Zen mode improvements.
- Finished turns show the time they completed next to the copy button.

### Fixed

- Full-width transcript layout: a user prompt no longer sits flush against the tool call under it.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Sidebar tabs read as rounded segments inset from the row rather than full-height boxes with dividers: Sessions, Explorer, and Changes in both layouts, and the inbox's GitHub and Linear tabs.
- The classic sidebar's project header no longer floats over the session list, and the Explorer's toolbar and root folder row stay pinned while the tree scrolls under them.

### Fixed

- Zen mode: expanding a settled turn's toolchain no longer folds it again when the turn's earlier tool calls were already open. The summary and the `+N previous` disclosure now track their own state.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Zen mode in Settings → General quiets a noisy transcript. While a turn runs, edits collapse into the same one-line activity list as reads and searches instead of stacking full diff cards; once the turn settles the whole toolchain folds behind a single `12 tool calls · 4 files edited` line, leaving the agent's closing answer. Edits waiting on approval still show their diff, since you cannot judge a change you cannot see. Off by default.
- Transcript layout in Settings → General: Full width keeps user prompts as a spanning card, Chat aligns them to the right with a max width.
- Copy button on completed agent turns, copying the assistant prose and any plan as Markdown.
- Inbox pull requests have Summary and Code tabs, with the `gh`-backed diff rendered as highlighted file changes (large diffs are truncated).
- Inbox shows a dot on the project rail and on cards for items that are new or updated since you last looked.

### Changed

- Edit rows read as `Edit src/lib/appearance.ts` with a file-type icon and a clickable path, matching how reads and searches already render.
- Inbox authors and assignees show avatars from GitHub and Linear, falling back to initials.
- Inbox author moved into the detail metadata row alongside assignees and time, instead of repeating in the body.
- New workspaces default to the Deck sidebar layout.

### Fixed

- Streamed Markdown keeps headings, blank lines, tables, and repeated characters. Completed Claude/Codex snapshots no longer paste the same reply twice. Diagnosed in #15 by @kinsomicrote.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Show in picker in Settings → Providers: hide an installed provider from the model picker without removing it from Settings.

### Changed

- The model picker only shows providers whose CLI is installed. Uninstalled harnesses stay listed in Settings → Providers.

### Fixed

- Claude usage in the footer refreshes OAuth tokens before they expire and retries on 401, so the chip stays signed in. Failed sign-in shows expired instead of a generic error.
- GitHub inbox and `gh` subprocesses work when MonoCode is launched from Finder, by resolving the CLI through the login-shell PATH the same way harnesses do.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Inbox: assigned GitHub issues and pull requests from `gh`, plus Linear issues after you paste a personal API key in Settings → General. Start an issue in a local project; pull requests open on GitHub instead of starting a session from an untrusted branch. Linear Start includes the issue description, since agents cannot fetch Linear pages.
- Starting from Inbox shows a Linear or GitHub card above the composer — logo, identifier, title, team or repo — instead of pasting the issue into the textarea. Send still includes the issue for the agent; you can add a note or dismiss the card.
- Claude and Codex plan usage (5-hour and weekly) shows in a footer under the main pane: percent used and time until reset. If a provider isn't installed or signed in, the chip says not connected and isn't polled again until you refresh or relaunch.
- While a turn is running, the project's pixel mascot patrols the composer (or the changes bar), hops the jump-to-latest control, and occasionally grabs a coin. Turn it off in Settings → General.

### Fixed

- Inbox still lists the other source when GitHub or Linear fails, with the error on that tab instead of a blank inbox.
- Linear team hiding and status filters apply to the active tab, and Start errors show in the issue detail pane.

### Security

- Linear personal API keys stay on this Mac: written to the app data folder (`~/Library/Application Support/com.monocode.desktop/linear-token`) with owner-only permissions (`0600`). They are sent only to Linear's API to list and read issues, never to MonoCode servers, and never placed in the agent prompt. Disconnect deletes the file. GitHub uses the `gh` login already on the machine; MonoCode does not store a GitHub token.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Select text in a finished agent response and choose **Add to chat** to quote that excerpt in the same session's composer.
- Projects with no conversations yet show an empty sessions state instead of a blank list.
- Switching or creating a branch prompts to stash or commit when checkout would overwrite local changes.

### Changed

- Branch picker stays put with a loading skeleton while git lookup settles.
- Session history is cached across projects and refreshed in the background, so switching back is instant.
- Startup is lighter: Material icons and Mermaid load on demand, and git, harness, and model probes are cached.

### Fixed

- Switching projects no longer flashes a loading spinner over the session list.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- omp ([oh-my-pi](https://omp.sh)) joins the provider list. Install it with `curl -fsSL https://omp.sh/install | sh` and log in, and MonoCode runs it like any other harness: live turns, steering, approvals, model catalog, and skills from `.omp/skills`.
- Check for updates in the classic sidebar footer.

### Changed

- Pi and omp share one adapter core. omp is a fork of Pi and speaks the same `--mode rpc` protocol, so both run on the same code path instead of two copies that drift apart.
- Classic layout opens the full settings page with `⌘,` instead of the appearance popover in the title bar. Section navigation lives in the sidebar while settings are open, and Settings sits at the bottom next to Check for updates.
- Deck layout shows Settings and Check for updates in the sidebar footer when the project rail is collapsed.
- Composer branch picker creates and checks out a branch in this folder.

### Fixed

- Deck layout no longer duplicates Settings and Check for updates when the project rail is open, or shows a title bar settings button while a project is selected.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Project rail context menu: Archive takes a project off the rail and keeps its conversations; Delete asks first, then also removes saved chats. Archived projects show up in Settings → Archive, where you can restore them to the rail or delete them. The folder on disk is left alone either way.
- Session branches: switching or creating a branch in a session checks it out in a git worktree, so the project's HEAD stays put. Sidebar changes and diffs follow that session's working copy, and the branch comes back when you restore the session.
- Per-provider default models in Settings → Providers. The model beside each provider is what new conversations use when that provider is selected.

### Changed

- Global search placeholder reads “Search everything…”, with tighter scope buttons and a clearer hover state on unselected scopes.
- Delete project confirmation states that all project conversations will be removed, with a separate count when saved conversations exist.

### Fixed

- Wide code blocks in the transcript scroll horizontally instead of clipping.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Deck layout: a second window layout, opt-in and off by default. Switch between Classic and Deck under Layout in the appearance menu. Deck puts a project rail down the left edge with every project you have opened, and scopes the title-bar tabs to the selected project instead of mixing all of them together. `⌘B` shows and hides the rail.
- Project rail cards show live state: an animated pixel mascot per project, a spinner and a shimmering name while a turn is running, and `+n -n` for uncommitted changes. Pick a different mascot for a project from its context menu.
- Project terminal dock (deck layout): terminals belong to the project rather than to one tab, and dock to the top, left, right, or bottom edge. `⌘J` hides and shows the dock, and the layout survives tab switches and restarts.
- Changes is a sidebar tab in deck layout, next to Sessions and Explorer, with the working-tree diff stats on the tab itself.
- Global search with `⌘K`: one field across files, projects, and past conversations, including the text of messages inside them.
- Settings page with `⌘,`: general, appearance, keybindings, providers, and archived sessions in one place.
- Sessions can start without a project in deck layout. The session opens with a project picker and you choose the folder when you are ready.
- Projects can be removed from the rail, with an option to also delete their saved chats and appearance settings. The folder on disk is left alone either way.
- Session archive: right-click a session in the sidebar to archive or unarchive it. Archived sessions are hidden by default and stay archived across restarts.
- Session sidebar filters: filter by provider, status (working, needs approval, done), and time (today, last 7 days, last 30 days). Toggle archived sessions from the filter menu. Filter choices persist across restarts.

Thanks [@Queaxtra](https://github.com/Queaxtra) for the filter and archive ideas.

### Changed

- A paused turn shows “Waiting for approval” in place of the timer instead of dropping the row, so the transcript no longer shifts while you decide.
- The changes view can be opened from the file tree header as well as the title bar. The title-bar control shows a diff icon when there are no uncommitted changes yet, and the close button was removed from the changes pane — use either toggle to show or hide it.
- Composer placeholder mentions `@` for file references.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Handoff: switching providers mid-session continues the chat on the next send. The new message goes to the incoming provider with a short recap of what happened and any files this chat edited. The divider shows a spinner and “Preparing a handoff” until that provider starts, then its logo and name.

### Fixed

- Read and Find rows show the file or search query next to the verb, instead of a bare Read/Find. Every provider uses the same nested-arg extraction; Cursor also recovers Glob/Grep from its session store when ACP sends empty input.
- Provider CLIs installed through a Node version manager (nvm, fnm, mise, Volta) no longer show as unavailable when MonoCode is launched from Finder. Detection reads PATH from an interactive login shell, so anything set up in `.zshrc` is found, and a disabled provider now says its CLI was not found instead of implying it needs to be authenticated.
- Codex works when only the Codex desktop app is installed. MonoCode falls back to the CLI bundled inside `Codex.app` when no standalone `codex` is on PATH, preferring a real install whenever one exists.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Updater archives now use immutable, versioned URLs so Cloudflare cannot pair a cached previous release with the latest signature.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Project files now show their Git status with color in the file tree.

### Fixed

- fx sessions no longer stall after the first turn or when starting another session; fast ACP responses are registered before they can be delivered, and failed transports are recycled cleanly.
- fx now exposes the model selected by its TUI even when `fx models --json` omits it, including GLM 5.2.
- fx tool activity shows useful file, search, command, output, and failure details instead of empty or misleading rows.
- Finder-launched builds pass the user environment and available Gateway credentials to fx instead of hanging on an invisible Keychain prompt.
- The access-mode control is hidden for fx because fx always runs in its automatic mode.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- fx as a harness: if `fx` is installed and logged in, it shows up next to Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and Pi. Live sessions spawn `fx acp` and talk Agent Client Protocol. fx does not accept image or audio attachments, so the attach button is disabled with a tooltip. Follow-up messages while a turn is running are not steered - wait for the turn to finish.
- Model picker shortcuts: `⌘.` (`Ctrl+.`) opens or closes it, and left/right arrows move between provider tabs.

### Fixed

- Closing a title-bar tab no longer flashes the sidebar session list. The cards stay on screen while history refreshes instead of disappearing and popping back.
- Git diff gutter and the Changes sidebar update live when files are modified externally, including after discarding a change, without closing and reopening the tab.
- The title-bar `+n -n` badge clears when the Changes sidebar shows no uncommitted files, instead of keeping stale addition/deletion counts.
- Launch no longer flashes a fully clear window: the boot splash uses the same `background-base` / glass tint as the loaded app.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Editor diff hunks show a centered gutter pill with revert and stage. Plus stages that hunk (or the selected lines) so you can commit some changes and leave the rest unstaged.
- Pi Coding Agent as a harness: if `pi` is installed, it shows up next to Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode. Live sessions spawn `pi --mode rpc` with the user's existing config and extensions loaded, so globally installed Pi packages (todos, subagents, custom tools) still run. Project-local `.pi` resources follow Pi's saved trust file. TUI-only widgets do not appear in MonoCode; extension confirm/select dialogs use the existing approval UI. MonoCode's runtime-mode control does not gate Pi tools - Pi has no native permission prompts.
- Closing the window no longer kills a running chat: MonoCode hides instead, and reopening the app brings the same window back mid-turn.
- Quit (⌘Q) asks first if chats are still running, then restores those sessions the next time you open the app and continues the turn.
- Reopening the app restores the last window: tabs, splits, and open file or terminal panes, instead of always starting on a blank homepage.

### Fixed

- Quitting during a later turn still resumes: a previous interrupt note no longer blocks Continue on the next quit.
- Opening a file scrolls its tab into view when the pane's tab strip overflows.
- Editor syntax lint no longer underlines valid TypeScript (arrow type predicates, typed `catch`, JSX comments, `typeof import()`) or Tailwind `@source` rules. Rust files are still highlighted but are not linted - the highlighter grammar was marking real code as errors.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Light mode: toggle Dark/Light in the appearance panel. Terminal, editor, markdown (including Mermaid), and sidebar all follow the scheme; preference persists across restarts.
- Editor syntax linting for supported source files (JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, HTML, Rust, and Python): lightweight diagnostics straight from the Lezer parse tree, with wavy red underlines and hover tooltips. Catches unclosed brackets, stray quotes, and other typo-class mistakes - not a type checker or language server.
- File tabs show syntax problems: the label turns red and the tooltip appends a problem count, similar to VS Code.
- Context meter in the composer: a ring showing how much of the model context window the session is using, with exact token counts on hover. It turns amber at 75% and red at 90%.
- Context usage is read from each CLI rather than estimated, so the window matches whatever model the session actually runs. Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode report it; Cursor does not expose token usage over ACP, so no meter is shown for Cursor sessions.
- The last context reading is stored with the session, so reopening a closed session shows its meter right away instead of waiting for the next turn.
- Tab back/forward, like a browser: ⌘[ and ⌘] walk the tabs you actually visited, not the order they sit in the strip. Buttons live in the sidebar header, or in the title bar when the sidebar is closed. View menu: Go Back / Go Forward. Closed tabs drop out of the stack; visiting a different tab after going back clears forward.
- Empty terminal panes grow a tiny snake on the grid. It hunts provider logos and pops a pixel speech bubble when it catches one.

### Fixed

- A tab is removed from its group when its session's project no longer matches the other tabs in that group.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-20

First public release. macOS (Apple Silicon) only.

### Added

- Desktop UI for the coding agent CLIs already installed on your machine: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode. Tabs are sessions, the composer is the input.
- Project file tree, editor with diff view, and full-text search.
- Git surface: staged and unstaged diffs, commit, push, pull, branch switching, and pull request creation.
- Session checkpoints with undo.
- Embedded terminal panes.
- In-app updater.

### Security

- `harness_exec` only runs resolver-produced harness CLIs with a fixed argument allowlist.
- Content Security Policy enabled on the webview. Production CSP excludes the Vite dev server; `devCsp` covers `tauri dev`.
- Agent markdown does not load remote images (`data:` images still work).
- Updater endpoint and minisign public key are injected at release time rather than committed, so forks do not inherit the maintainer's update channel.
- macOS release builds sign with `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` via a config overlay; the committed default remains ad-hoc `-` for community builds.
